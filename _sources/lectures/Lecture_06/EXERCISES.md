# Exercises for Lecture 6

## Exercise 6.1

Determine the zero of the function *g(x) = cos(x)* using the bisection method
in the interval *(0, 4)*.
  * Which checks have been omitted in the implementation of the algorithm
    described in the lesson text that could speed up the result?

## Exercise 6.2

Perform the previous exercise using a recursive function.
  * Which of the two implementations is faster?

## Exercise 6.3

Implement a function that calculates the factorial of a number
using a recursive function.

## Exercise 6.4

Determine the minimum of the function *g(x) = x<sup>2</sup> + 7.3x + 4*
using the golden ratio search method in the interval *(-10, 10)*.

## Exercise 6.5

Perform the previous exercise using a recursive function.
  * Which of the two implementations is faster?

## Exercise 6.6

Complete the two previous exercises by finding the maximum of a chosen function.

## Exercise 6.7

Modifying the previously developed programs,
use ```matplotlib``` to plot the studied functions and the points found 
using the bisection and golden section search methods.
