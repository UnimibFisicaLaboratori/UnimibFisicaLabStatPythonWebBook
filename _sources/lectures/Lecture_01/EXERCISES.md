# Exercises for Lecture 1

## Exercise 1.1

  * Write a program that reads an integer given as input from the user 
    and determines whether it is divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.
  * Encapsulate the check into a function taking as input two numbers,
    and write a program that asks the user to insert two numbers 
    and checks whether the first is divisible by the other one (and vice-versa).

## Exercise 1.2

  * Write a program that, given the three sides of a triangle, 
    determines whether the triangle is acute-angled, rectangular-angled or obtuse-angled.

## Exercise 1.3

  * Write a program that, by using a `while` loop, 
    returns the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th term
    and stores it in a python `list`.

## Exercise 1.4

  * Write a program that, by using a `for` loop, 
    returns the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th term
    and stores it in a python `dictionary`, 
    where the `key` represents the index of each element
    and `value` its actual value.

## Exercise 1.5

  * Define a function that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th term.

    `````{hint}
    The function prototype could be

    ```python
    def fibonacci (n) :
        """A function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th term

        Args:
            n (int): the n-th term of the sequence

        Returns:
            list: a list with the Fibonacci sequence
        """
    ```
    `````
  * Test the function with a `main` program,
    filling a `list` with the elements of the sequence.
  * Create a new list containing only the elements with even index in the `list`.  
  * Create a new list containing only the elements with odd index in the `list`.
  * Move the function in a library and import it in the main program.

## Exercise 1.6

  * By writing a suitable program and functions,
    verify whether the value of variables passed to a function
    get modified in the main program, 
    if they are changed inside the function.
  * Perform the check for the various types described during the lecture.
