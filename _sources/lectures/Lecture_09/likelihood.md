# The likelihood

## Programming with notebooks

  * Notebooks are **documents that contain
    rich text elements** (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦)
    **and computer code** (e.g. python),
    and can show the output of the code integrated within the document.
  * They may be exploited in keeping in the same place
    the actual developed algorithms
    **together with their description and results comments**.
  * Python notebooks may be implemented locally, 
    for example with the **[jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) software**,
    or remotely, for example with **[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/?hl=it)**
    or with [binder](https://mybinder.org/).
  * Notebooks may **run source code written in them**
    and **load existing libraries.**

## jupyter notebooks

  * In an environment where the jupyter program is installed,
    **notebooks are accessible trough web browsers**
  * The notebook user interface may be **opened with the following shell command**:  
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
  * This call **opens a web browser window** containing
    a list of the current folder and some commands
    among which that to create a new notebook

### Creating a jupyter notebook

  * After creating a new notebook,
    an empty page is generated,
    where single elements of the notebook may be **added
    by clicking on the ```+``` button**
  * Elements may be of two types:
    * ```Code```, which shall be filled with actual python source code
    * ```Markdown```, which shall be filled with rich text, 
      formatted according to the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) 
      [syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
      (this document is written using the markdown syntax)

### Running a jupyter notebook

  * Once a notebook as been created,
    **it can be run.**
  * The ```code``` sections are **executed in sequence**,
    as if they are part of a single source program,
    and **the output of each element**
    will appear just after it.
    ```{warning}
    In a complex notebook,
    all elements need to be run sequentially from the beginning,
    to avoid mismatches between variable values across 
    execution
    ```   
  * The ```markdown``` sections will be compiled
    and **graphically rendered** according to the markdown syntax.   
  * The **computational engine** that performs the actual calculations
    is called a *kernel*
    and in the python case is based on the [ipython](https://pypi.org/project/ipython/) library
    ```{warning}
    For each notebook a dedicated kernel is run,
    therefore it's smart to avoid runnning several notebooks
    without [shutting them down](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html#kernel-shutdown)
    when not useful.
    ```

### Accessing files on disk

  * Files on disk may be **accessed from a notebook**,
    either to load existing libraries,
    or to write or read data files
  * The library shall be **located in the same folder as the notebook**,
    and used as in any other python source code 

## Google Colaboratory notebooks

  * The Google suite gives access to a python notebook system, called **Google Colaboratory**
  * Each notebook **may be accessed** from the Google Colab starting page,
    or from Google Drive
  * The fundamental working principles of the notebooks are the same 
    as the ones of jupyter

### Using non-installed libraries in Google Colab

  * Python libaries which are not installed in the Google operative system
    **may be installed when needed**, 
    by using the ```pip``` installer within a notebook itself:
    ```python
    # installing the iminuit library for use in a Google Colab notebook
    !pip install iminuit
    from iminuit import Minuit
    ```

### Accessing Google Drive from a Google Colab notebook

  * The **disk which may be addressed** from a Google Colab notebook
    is that provided by Google Drive
  * A Google Drive folder shall be mounted before being accessible:
  ```python
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount ('/content/drive')
  ```  
  * An **official example notebook** showing local file upload/download 
    and integration with Google Drive may be found at this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb#scrollTo=vz-jH8T_Uk2c) 

### Notebooks pros and cons

  ::::{important}
    | Advantages |
    | ---------- |

    * The code running, output and documentation are in the same place
    * The effects of code changes may be very quickly observed

    | Disadvantages |
    | ------------- |

    * The overall call may not be seen at a glance with a text editor
    * The separate running of single cells may scramble the logic of the whole program
    * The running of the same notebook in different tabs generates random behaviours

## The Likelihood

  * All the information that characterizes an experiment, 
    summarizing both the theoretical assumptions and the measurements taken, 
    is encoded in the **likelihood**, 
    defined as the product of the value of the probability density distribution 
    calculated for each measurement taken 
    (for independent identically-distributed random values x<sub>i</sub>):
<!--
    $$
    \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(\theta;\vec{x}) = f(x_1,\theta)\times ... \times f(x_N,\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^N f(x_i,\theta)
    $$ -->
  ![likelihood](../../figs/likelihood.png)
  * The **likelihood** is a function of both the measurements and the parameters; 
    however, usually **only the dependence on the parameters is highlighted**
    because with finite measurements, the data remain fixed.

### A model describing the data

  * A **model** is a probability distribution *f* or a law *g* 
    to which measurements are expected to conform.
  * The **measurement outcomes** are variables with respect to which the model depends.
  * Any quantities on which the model depends, which are not measured, 
    are referred to as **parameters**.

### Probability Density Functions

  * Given a set of real measurements x<sub>i</sub> defined on a set &Omega; 
    that are independently and identically distributed, 
    we know that they follow a **given probability density distribution**, 
    generally denoted as *f(x, &theta;)*.
  * This means that *f(x<sub>i</sub>, &theta;)* is the **probability density** 
    for the measurement to occur at point x<sub>i</sub> within the definition set &Omega;.
  * The **symbol &theta;** indicates that the probability density function *f* 
    depends on parameters other than *x*.
    * &theta; can also be a vector of parameters.
    * For example, a Gaussian distribution has two additional parameters, &mu; e &sigma;:
![gaussian](../../figs/gaussian.png)

## The logarithm of the Likelihood

  * Often, for calculations and graphical representations, 
    the **logarithm of the likelihood function** is used, 
    denoted by a lowercase italic letter:
![loglikelihood](../../figs/loglikelihood.png)
  * In fact, since the logarithm is a **monotonically increasing function**, 
    the behavior of the likelihood and its logarithm are similar.
  * The logarithm of a product of terms 
    is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the individual terms:

    $$\log(\mathcal{L}(\theta;\vec{x})) = \log\left(\prod_{i=1}^N f(x_i,\theta)\right) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log\left(f(x_i,\theta)\right)$$

  * The logarithm of a number is smaller than the number itself 
    and varies over a smaller range compared to the variability of the number, 
    therefore **operations involving logarithms can be more numerically stable**.

## Building a Likelihood function

  * We will use the example of the exponential distribution, 
    with the sole parameter &tau; as an additional argument of the likelihood:
![esponenziale](../../figs/esponenziale.png)

### The Probability Density Function and the Likelihood function

  * The first step in the study is the **writing of the source code** for the
    probability density function and the likelihood itself:
    ```py
    def exp_pdf (x, tau) :
        '''
        the exponential probability density function
        '''
        if tau == 0. : return 1.
        return exp (-1 * x / tau) / tau
    ```
    * the first ```if``` **protects the program** from infinity calculations
  * the likelihood function will have **as a input**
    both the data and the parameter of interest:
    ```py
    def loglikelihood (theta, pdf, sample) :
        '''
        the log-likelihood function calculated
        for a sample of independent variables idendically distributed 
        according to their pdf with parameter theta
        '''
        risultato = 0.
        for x in sample:
          if (pdf (x, theta) > 0.) : risultato = risultato + log (pdf (x, theta))    
        return risultato
    ```
    * in this case,
      the logarithm of the probability density function is **calculated
      in each data point**
