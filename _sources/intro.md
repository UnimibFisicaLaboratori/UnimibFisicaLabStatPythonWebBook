# Laboratory of Statistics

This book collects the lectures for the Laboratory of Statistics, a second-year course for the bachelor in Physics at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

The target of this course is to provide a first introduction to 
statistical programming and to make it practical for the data analysis of typical experiments performed during the bachelor studies of General Physics.

The course is structured in 12 lectures during which various exercises, covering the topics of the frontal lectures in Statistics, will be proposed together with their solutions.

See below for a detailed table of contents.
